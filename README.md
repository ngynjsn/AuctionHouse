# Auction House Simulator
### By: Jason Nguyen

**Features of the Application:**

- In this application, users will be allowed to put items up for sale like if
it were an auction house. Items can be added and the auction will begin with the first
item on the list. Users get to choose *starting price*, *bidding price*, *buy out offers*, and a
*countdown* for bids. If anyone were to make a bid, the cost of the item goes up, 
and the countdown refreshes. If the bid goes past the buy out offer, the item goes to the
last person who made the bid. People who are allowed to bid can straight up offer the price 
of buy out offers to purchase the item.

**Users and Interest:**

- This application will be used for people who have items they would like to sell. Instead
of having to choose who to sell it to, an auction house would be fun and maximizes the seller's profit. 
This project is of interest to me because I like the idea of incorporating a countdown simulator.
It'll challenge me to figure out how to terminate the function after a time interval and start it up again.
